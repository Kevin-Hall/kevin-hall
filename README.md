# Hello im Kev! - aka Developer Hall

I am a recent graduate from the University of Masssachussets Amherst (december 2020) seeking employment as a software engineer. I prefer to work on mobile (iOS) however I would be more than happy to contribute my wide array of technical skills to a team thats building something unique and meaningful.
